## What is Diceware?

> Dicewareâ„¢ is a method for picking passphrases that uses ordinary dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.[^1]

Here's what a Diceware word list looks like:

```
...
16655 clause
16656 claw
16661 clay
16662 clean
16663 clear
16664 cleat
16665 cleft
16666 clerk
21111 cliche
21112 click
...
```
{: file='diceware.txt'}

The complete list contains 7776 unique words. I've posted the one I use on my GitHub. You can download it [here][diceware-word-list].

## Breaking it down

Objective: Create a secure password

1. Roll a die five times to create a five digit number (eg. 52334)
2. Get a special char and a number
3. Correlate roll to a word in the word list
4. Profit

## Code

```python
import random, string
```

As you can see, the only libraries you'll need to import are `random` and `string`. Random for the simulated die rolls and string so we don't have to type out all the special characters.

### Main function

```python
def generate_password():
    passwd = []
    num = 3

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 999
    rand_num = str(random.randint(1, 999))

    for w in range(num):
        # Generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 6
        roll = ''.join([str(random.randint(1, 6)) for _ in range(5)])
        word = wl_dict[roll]

        # Randomly capitalizes the current word
        if random.randrange(2) == 1:
            word = word.capitalize()

        # Appends word to array
        passwd.append(word)

        # Generate a random special character
        passwd.append(random.choice(string.punctuation))

    # Concatenate the words, number, and special character to form the password
    final_pw = ''.join(passwd) + rand_num

    return final_pw
```

The `num` variable allows us to specify how many words we want in our password. For me, three is the sweet spot. Next we generate a random number between 1-999. Finally, we get to our beefy for loop.

- `roll`: simulates our die roll resulting in a five digit number
- `word`: searches our dictionary and stores the word in our variable

The if statement basically does a coin flip and will capitalize the word if it rolls a one. The two lines below the if statement append the selected word and a random special character to our empty `passwd` array. At the end our `passwd` variable will look like **['Junkie', '~', 'undivided', '%', 'Disorder', '#']**

- `final_pw`: joins all of the elements in the `passwd` array into one string and adds our random number (ie. **"Junkie~undivided%Disorder#943"**)

### Creating our word list dictionary

```python
# Load the diceware word list
with open("diceware.txt", "r") as f:
    wl = [line.strip() for line in f]

wl_dict = {}
for line in range(len(wl)):
    l = wl[line].split("\t")
    wl_dict[l[0]] = l[1]
```

This part used to be way longer and over complicated for no reason. But, I fixed it. While our file is open we create the array `wl` which contains every line. However, our file has tabs in it for some reason so we can't just split it normally. Instead we'll create an empty dictionary and a for loop. In our for loop we can iterate line by line and split by that tab with `\t`. Then we just append to our dictionary `wl_dict` with the key being the number `l[0]` and value being the word `l[1]`.

### Calling our function

```python
print("Password = " + generate_password())
```

Finally, we call our function which returns our finished password and print.

## Conclusion

If you made it this far, you now have to go and change all your passwords. I hope you're not reusing the same password for everything. *Tisk* *Tisk* *Tisk*. If you want a video tutorial, the YouTube channel Computerphile[^2] has a great video going over this topic. If you just want to run the script and not have to worry about all the coding, download it from my GitHub[^3] or run the web app I spent way too long on above.
