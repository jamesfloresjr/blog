## Setup
Setup a server of your choice. The commands in this tutorial will be for Ubuntu Server 22.04 but the steps should be the same. Here are the specifications I use for my templates.

> You cannot decrease the hard disk so choose something low (20-50 GBs). You can increase after cloning.
{: .prompt-info }

- Disks
  - Disk size (GiB): `50`
- CPU
  - Sockets: `2`
  - Cores: `4`
  - Total cores: `8` (sockets x cores)
- Memory
  - Memory (MiB): `4096` (4 GB)
  - Minimum memory (MiB): `1024` (1 GB)

## Configuring
After logging in (console or ssh, preferably ssh) run these commands.

```bash
# update and upgrade system
sudo apt-get update -y && time sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y

# removes host ssh files
sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

# zeroes out the file, makes it a blank file
sudo truncate -s 0 /etc/machine-id
```

If you want your new VMs to come preloaded with certain config files, etc. now's the time to do so. Some things I like to do is install the QEMU Guest Agent and change my console font and size.

## Covert to template

> This step is permanent and cannot be undone.
{: .prompt-warning }

Shutdown your VM and go back to Proxmox. Right click on the VM you just created and click `Covert to template`. You officially have a template. There's a couple more steps I want to show you but you're essentially done.

### Remove Media
I like to remove the Ubuntu ISO by navigating to the `Hardware` tab and setting `CD/DVD Drive(ide2)` to `Do not use any media`.

### Cloud-Init
Last step is to configure Cloud-Init. Navigate to the `Hardware` tab and add a `CloudInit Drive`. Next go to the `Cloud-Init` tab and add your default user/password as well as your public SSH key. Once complete, click `Regenerate Image`.

## Cloning
After cloning, you'll need to change your hostname. Edit the two files below and reboot.

- `/etc/hostname`{: .filepath}
- `/etc/hosts`{: .filepath}
